Weather Analysis Project | Python Application

A Python-based weather data analysis project that focuses on data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning. The project demonstrates working with CSV datasets, calculating statistics, plotting graphs, and training predictive models.

Main Features:

-Load and clean weather datasets (CSV)

-Calculate monthly averages for temperature and humidity

-Plot monthly temperature trends with line charts

-Generate seasonal boxplots for temperature distributions

-Train and evaluate a Random Forest model to predict seasons based on temperature and humidity

Key Focus:

-Writing clean, modular, and reusable Python functions

-Working with pandas for data manipulation and numpy for numerical operations

-Using matplotlib and seaborn for effective data visualization

-Implementing basic machine learning with scikit-learn

-Developing a step-by-step workflow from raw data to insights

Technologies:
 Pyton, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
